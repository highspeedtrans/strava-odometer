# prototyping notes / resources
### electronics
- [Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13231) board, for cheapness, built-in wifi, Arduino community support
    - [Sparkfun tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-thing-hookup-guide)
    - needs programmer, using [Sparkfun FTDI Basic 3.3V](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873)
    - should've just bought [Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing DEV](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13711) (instead of non-dev version), which has the USB-serial built in

### software
- [Sparkfun IoT Experiment Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/internet-of-things-experiment-guide) with examples of ESP8266 used in client mode
